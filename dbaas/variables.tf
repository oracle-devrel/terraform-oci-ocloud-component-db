# This variable file contains variables for all types of DBaaS databases however as the scope is VM only,
# all non VM ones are commented.
# 
# DBaaS supports 3 different types of sources for creating a database. For this usecase we focus on 'NONE'
# which creates a new database.
#
# Source types:
# NONE: Create a new database
# DATABASE: Create a new database from an existing database, including archive redo log data.
# DB_BACKUP: Create a new database by restoring from a backup
